## 📈 Data Analysis Plan

### Analysis 1: Current vs Forecast Accuracy
**Question:** How accurate are weather API forecasts vs our ML model?

**Method:**
```
1. Collect 2 weeks of data:
   - API forecasts (1h, 3h, 6h ahead)
   - ML model predictions
   - Actual observed values

2. Calculate metrics:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
   - Directional accuracy (% correct trend)

3. Compare:
   - API only
   - ML model only
   - Ensemble (API + ML)
```

**Expected result:** Ensemble performs best

### Analysis 2: Seasonal Patterns
**Question:** Does wind vary by time of day/season?

**Method:**
```
1. Collect 1-3 months of hourly data

2. Analyze:
   - Hourly patterns (morning vs evening)
   - Daily patterns (weekday vs weekend)
   - Weather patterns (sunny vs rainy days)

3. Visualize:
   - Heatmaps: Hour of day vs wind speed
   - Time series: Wind trends over weeks
   - Distributions: Wind speed by time period
```

**Use case:** "Best time to play is 6-8 AM (lowest wind)"

### Analysis 3: Location Comparison
**Question:** How does wind differ across campus?

**Method:**
```
1. Get data for multiple locations:
   - Main badminton court
   - Alternate court
   - Nearest weather station

2. Compare:
   - Average wind speeds
   - Correlation between locations
   - Time lag effects

3. Build location-specific models
```

**Use case:** "Court A is 20% windier than Court B"

### Analysis 4: Prediction Horizon Optimization
**Question:** What's the optimal forecast horizon?

**Method:**
```
1. Evaluate accuracy at different horizons:
   - 30 min, 1h, 2h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h

2. Find sweet spot:
   - Accurate enough for planning
   - Far enough ahead to be useful

3. Optimize model:
   - Focus on most useful horizons
   - Drop low-accuracy long-term forecasts
```

**Expected:** 1-3h is sweet spot

### Analysis 5: False Alarm vs Miss Rate
**Question:** What threshold minimizes bad decisions?

**Method:**
```
1. Collect outcomes:
   - Bot said PLAY → Was it actually safe?
   - Bot said DON'T PLAY → Could you have played?

2. Calculate:
   - False alarms: Said don't play, but was safe
   - Misses: Said play, but was too windy
   - Optimal threshold for your risk tolerance

3. Adjust thresholds dynamically
```

**Trade-off:** Safety vs opportunity

## 💡 Advanced Features Ideas

### 1. Ensemble Forecasting
Combine multiple sources for best accuracy:
```
Final Forecast = 
  0.4 × API Forecast +
  0.3 × ML Model +
  0.2 × Persistence (last value) +
  0.1 × Climatology (historical average)
```

### 2. Adaptive Thresholds
Learn from user feedback:
```
If users often play at 1.6 m/s:
→ Adjust threshold from 1.5 to 1.6
```

### 3. Nowcasting
Ultra-short term (0-30 min) predictions:
```
Use last 6 observations to predict next 30 min
Better than API for immediate decisions
```

### 4. Court-Specific Models
Train separate models for each court:
```
Court A (open field): More sensitive to wind
Court B (sheltered):  Can tolerate higher wind
```

### 5. Weather Pattern Recognition
Identify conditions that lead to wind changes:
```
Rain approaching → Wind increases
Sunset → Wind decreases
Hot afternoon → Wind peaks
```
